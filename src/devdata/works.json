Although Brackeys has already left Youtube for a while, I always hope to join his game jam, to make SOMETHING with the fellow developers.<br>This is the first game jam I participated. Producing a THING in several days is not easy, but the developing process is really fun and I will join more game jam in the future!<br>It is suggested to play in standalone app, playing in web might have laggy issues.
